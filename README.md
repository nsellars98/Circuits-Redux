# Circuits-Redux
A reworking of the Java Circuit app in CPP using classes, inheritance, and dynamic memory allocation.

Despite a memory leak where pointers in the vectors of the subclasses did not get deleted, the app is a working solution.

For a more detailed description of this project, see the "Circuits" repository.

This app was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community (various versions).

Thanks for looking!
