# Circuits-Redux
A reworking of the Java Circuit app in CPP using classes, inheritance, and dynamic memory allocation.

Despite a memory leak where pointers in the vectors of the subclasses did not get deleted (fixed), the app is a working solution.

For a more detailed description of this project, see the "README.md" in the "Circuits" repository. The only key differences being a vector of circuits was used (instead of a list) and the added complexity of dynamic memory allocation via pointers. Otherwise, the project structure is virtually identical.

Proof of test cases can be found in the corresponding Word document along with screenshots showing the code when running.

This app was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community (various versions).

Thanks for looking!
